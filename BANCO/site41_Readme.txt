Release Notes:

By default your SWiSHsite is installed to the My Documents\SWiSHsite41 directory. 
Within that directory is the Guide (site41 Compiled HTML Help File), which includes 
step-by-step instructions for customizing your site. 

Before testing any of your movies, you should export the main movie (File | Export | SWF) 
to the UPLOAD folder. This will ensure that the movies can communicate and you can properly 
test your changes. 

IMPORTANT: Failure to export the SWF to the UPLOAD folder before testing in the internal player 
could result in error messages. Note that these error messages occur because your movie is 
attempting to communicate with a movie that is not present; once you export your SWF and test 
it from the main movie it will work fine.

Do not export the HTML as this page has been created for you and contains code which positions 
your movie and removes borders from the page so that you movie displays correctly.
